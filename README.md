  category, and customer purchase patterns. Excel was employed for detailed sales forecasting and ad-hoc reporting. The analysis highlighted seasonal sales trends, 
  top-performing products, and revenue growth opportunities, enabling data-driven decision-making for targeted marketing and sales strategies.

  exploratory analysis to uncover patterns in genres, release years, and audience ratings. Power BI dashboards provided interactive and dynamic visualizations, 
  including charts for average ratings, top-rated genres, and trends over time. Insights revealed correlations between ratings and factors such as release dates 
  and genres, helping stakeholders understand audience preferences and market trends. The project enabled data-driven decisions for content recommendation and film
